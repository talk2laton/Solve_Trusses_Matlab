# Solve_Trusses_Matlab
The project present a method to solve trusses using Matlab interactively.

## How to load the application 
1. Download this file from [Matlab file exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/134451-interactive-truss-solver) or clone from this github repository
2. Extract the zip file if you downloaded from Matlab file exchange
3. Run the "TrussesSolver.mlapp" to get the user interface

## How to solve a truss using this application
1. We shall use [problem 3.7 (2 d) from this page](https://learnaboutstructures.com/Chapter-3-Practice-Problems) to demonstrate how to use this aplication
2. Enter the incremental xtick positions for the nodes on the structure in the xTicks field and click on the UIAxis for update. For this problem, thats "1.5,0.5,1,2,2,2,2". ![alt text](https://github.com/talk2laton/Solve_Trusses_Matlab/blob/main/xtick.png)
3. Enter the incremental ytick positions for the nodes on the structure in the yTicks field and click on the UIAxis for update. For this problem, thats "1,1.75,0.25,1.5,1". ![alt text](https://github.com/talk2laton/Solve_Trusses_Matlab/blob/main/ytick.png)
4. Click the "Add Point" botton and continue to click the points you want to add on the UIAxis  ![alt text](https://github.com/talk2laton/Solve_Trusses_Matlab/blob/main/add%20point.png)
